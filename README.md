# HospitalDB
I designed database system for a hospital to manage its 
patient information, doctors information and the department they belong to, 
appointments, medical records, departments, and related entities. The primary goal is to 
design a relational database that ensures data integrity, supports efficient data retrieval 
and manipulation, and meets the specific requirements outlined by the hospital. 
To tackle this task effectively, I'll start by thoroughly understanding the requirements 
provided by the hospital, including the entities involved, their attributes, relationships 
between entities, and any constraints or business rules that need to be enforced. Then, 
I will now use T-SQL statements in the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to 
construct the database schema. 
The database design will involve creating tables for each entity, creating primary and 
foreign key links across tables, specifying suitable data types for each attribute, and 
putting constraints in place to preserve data integrity. In order to improve functionality 
and optimize database operations, I'll also add views, stored procedures, functions, and 
triggers as needed. 
Throughout the process, I'll document the design decisions made, justify the choices of 
data types, constraints, and other database elements, and provide clear explanations 
and justifications for each step. Screenshots of the database schema, along with 
sample T-SQL statements, will be included to support the documentation and ensure 
clarity. 
Overall, the approach will be systematic and methodical, ensuring that the resulting 
database meets the hospital's requirements, adheres to best practices in database 
design, and provides a solid foundation for managing patient and healthcare-related 
data effectively.
